This project is a university assignment, showcasing a first-person adventure game developed in Unity. The game features enhanced enemy AI, where enemies actively detect and pursue the player within a specified field of view. The player character can move, jump, and attack enemies, while both players and enemies have health systems that determine their survival in the game. Additional mechanics include enemy attacks with fireballs, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and visual representation of enemy detection zones for improved gameplay clarity. The project demonstrates fundamental gameplay mechanics, AI behavior, and player interaction within a 3D environment.
